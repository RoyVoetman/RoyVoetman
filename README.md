# Hello! I'm Roy Voetman <img align="right" src="https://www.royvoetman.nl/images/apple-04.svg" alt="Logo with a cartoon version of me on a playing card" width="200">

Iâ€™m an IT student at Hanze University of Applied Sciences majoring in Software Engineering. I currently work at Noardcode, a company that deals with the development of online applications to automate business processes, where I mainly focus on developing, expanding and optimizing a wide array of (laravel) back-end projects.
